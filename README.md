# Case for Senior Flutter Developer at Fika

## The Photo Editor
You are the newest member of a startup that makes a camera app. You have been recruited to build the next feature that they want - a photo editor mode that can allow the user to upload their photos and edit them using different things, similar to how Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat Stories are presented. This startup is very small and the previous Flutter developer just quit so you have now become the sole developer for this feature. Please implement a photo editor feature using Flutter.

## Requirements
The photo editor should have these features:
* **Allow user to upload a photo from the photo album**
* **Allow user to put regular stickers on their photo (example: Instagram Story)**
* **Allow user to add photo filter overlays like (example: Instagram filters)**
* Allow user to upload multiple photos and put them together (example: Instagram collage)
* Allow user to add description tags for objects and people in the photo

The **bolded** bullet points are **mandatory** and must be implemented, the rest can be done if you have time. If you can think of any other features or want to explore some other additions, feel free to only take the bolded of the mentioned bullet points and implement your own new features in addition instead of following the exact requirements.

## Resources
Please add resources and libraries here for them to use.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate your project depending on these factors:
* The code quality
* The implementation of the requirements
* How well you followed the feature requirements
* Documentation

Please submit your test to oscar@keepfika.com **latest 48 hours** after you've gained access to this repository. Feel free to use any resources online, just make sure to document it clearly in your code or supporting documents. 

Good luck and have fun!
