# Case for Senior Flutter Developer at Fika

## The Photo Editor
You are the newest member of a startup that makes a camera app. You have been recruited to build the next feature that they want - a photo editor mode that can allow the user to upload their photos and edit them using different things, similar to how Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat Stories are presented. This startup is very small and the previous Flutter developer just quit so you have now become the sole developer for this feature. Please implement a photo editor feature using Flutter.

## Requirements
The photo editor should have these features:
* **Allow user to upload a photo from the photo album**
* **Allow user to put regular stickers on their photo and move them around (example: Instagram Story)**
    * 1) It is recommended that you have some type of way to allow the users to move their stickers on the picture and place them where they want (similar to IG).
* Allow user to add photo filter overlays like (example: Instagram filters)
* Add Local State - User can continue to edit a photo and keep a draft version
* Allow user to upload multiple photos and put them together (example: Instagram collage)
* Allow user to add description tags for objects and people in the photo

The **bolded** bullet points are **mandatory** and must be implemented, the rest can be done if you have time. If you can think of any other features or want to explore some other additions, feel free to only take the bolded of the mentioned bullet points and implement your own new features in addition instead of following the exact requirements.

## Resources

4. path_provider (to allow storing photo files on Device)
5. image_picker (Flutter plugin for Android/iOS image capture and selection)

## Evaluation
